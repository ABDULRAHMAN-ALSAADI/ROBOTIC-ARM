#🤖 Robotic Arm Prototype
## A 5 DOF Robotic Arm 🦾 Designed By Me Using Solidworks.

This project showcases the early-stage design of a 5 Degrees of Freedom (5-DOF) robotic arm, fully modeled in SolidWorks. It's still a prototype — work in progress —

💡 What It Is:

A mechanical robotic arm with 5 rotational joints designed to mimic human-arm-like movements. 
It's built to handle basic automation tasks such as object manipulation, pick-and-place, and more.

🛠️ Tech Stack:

CAD Software: SolidWorks

Design Style: Modular, parametric

DOF: 5 rotational axes

Status: 🧪 Prototype (Under Development)

🚧 What's Next?

🔄 Redesign weak joints for smoother motion and increased durability

🧱 Add mounting support for motors and end effectors

📐 Refine link dimensions for better kinematics

🧠 Plan for control system integration (Arduino / ROS / etc.)


🌟 Goal
To evolve this prototype into a fully functional robotic arm system suitable for small-scale automation, lab tasks, or integration with mobile platforms like AGVs/AMRs.
